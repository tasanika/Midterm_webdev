<h1 class="fullWidth breaker" id="leo">Leo</h1>
<div class="card-size">
<p>Leo had to do with the labors of Heracles. On his first task, he was sent to kill the Nemean Lion. This lion was savage and fearless as he couldn't be harmed by weapons. After attempting to kill the lion with arrows, which just bounced right off, Heracles wrestled the lion and strangled it to death. He didn't go away unharmed, though; the lion managed to bite off one of Heracles' fingers. After the lion was dead, Heracles skinned it with it's own claws and made some wonderful armor from the pelt and jaw. The constellation Leo is said to honor the bravery of battle between the Nemean Lion and Heracles.<p>

The princess was awestruck by the beauty of the bull and walked over to pet it. She then climbed upon his back at which Zeus jumped into the water and carried her across the sea to Crete. He took the form of an eagle there and ravished her. She eventually bore him three sons whose names were Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon.
